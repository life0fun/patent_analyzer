# Patent Comparison Report

## Similarities
- Both claims describe methods for controlling aerial vehicles (UAVs and drones).
- Each method involves receiving a signal (from a remote controller or user device) to determine a target or destination.

## Differences
- **Claim A** focuses on calculating a flight path and actuating a motor to follow that path, without mention of obstacle detection.
- **Claim B** includes detecting obstacles and computing alternative routes, which adds a layer of complexity and adaptability to the drone's operation.

## Potential Overlaps
- Both claims involve signal reception and destination determination, which could be areas of overlap in terms of functionality.
